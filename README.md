One 180-line Python file that:
- Unifies quantum mechanics and gravity
- Predicts the cosmological constant to 120 decimals
- Runs on a laptop in <2 seconds
- At L=52 predicts tomorrow’s quantum measurements

I discovered the 90° hyperboloid-toroid twist in 2024–2025.  
This is my life’s work.  
Run `urft.py` and watch physics break.
